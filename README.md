This addon offers suggestions on how you can improve the HTML, CSS and UX of your components to be more mobile-friendly.

This is a rewrite of Alex Holachek's original [storybook-mobile](https://github.com/aholachek/storybook-mobile) addon to make it compatible with the more recent versions of Storybook.

## Quick Start

`yarn add -D storybook-mobile-addon` or `npm install --save-dev storybook-mobile-addon`

Next, add `storybook-mobile-addon` to your list of addons:

`.storybook/main.js`

```diff
module.exports = {
  // other config goes here
  addons: [
+    'storybook-mobile-addon'
  ],
}
```

This addon works best along with the [@storybook/addon-viewport](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/viewport) addon, so please install that as well if you don't have it already.
